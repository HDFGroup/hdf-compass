"""
The following class definitions represent the pluggable data model.

By subclassing various things in this module, and implementing the missing
(virtual) methods and properties, you can have the GUI infrastructure display
your own objects without writing a single line of wxPython code.  GUI
support exists for generic kinds of objects including browsable containers,
array-like datasets, and images.

More importantly, you can add support for entirely new file formats.

To implement support for a new kind of "datastore" (HDF5, HDF4, NetCDF, etc.),
start by subclassing Store and overriding the appropriate methods and
properties.  Then, subclass the various Node classes this module provides
(Container, Array, Image, etc.) and implement the various virtual bits of
those classes as well:

    class FooStore(compass_model.Store):
        ...

    class FooGroup(compass_model.Container):
        ...

    class FooDataset(compass_model.Array):
        ...

    class FooPicture(compass_model.Image):
        ...

You're not required to do all of them (and of course not all formats provide
something like an Image), but the more you implement the more capable the
interface will be.

So that your Store class knows which kinds of nodes are available to open,
manually register your Node subclasses:

    FooStore.push(FooGroup)
    FooStore.push(FooDataset)
    FooStore.push(FooPicture)

Finally, let the rest of the world know about your new data store support by
calling this module's register() function:

    compass_model.push(FooStore)

You can also extend other peoples' stores.  Suppose there's a module for
reading HDF5 files, with a store class called foohdf5.HDF5Store,
but the author didn't support the HDF5 Image standard.  Just write a subclass
of Image, and register it with the other person's class:

    class MyHDF5Image(Image):
        ...

    foohdf5.HDF5Store.push(MyHDF5Image)

Of course, this assumes you know enough about the internals of the other
person's Store to make your new class useful.
